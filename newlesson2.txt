    <h1>What is </h1>
<?php


//php function
// PHP has a lot of built-in functions that can be called directly, from within a script, to perform a specific task.
// it is possible to create your own functions.




//--------------




// What is an Exception
// With PHP 5 came a new object oriented way of dealing with errors.
// Exception handling is used to change the normal flow of the code execution if a specified error (exceptional) condition occurs. This condition is called an exception.

// This is what normally happens when an exception is triggered:

// The current code state is saved
// The code execution will switch to a predefined (custom) exception handler function
// Depending on the situation, the handler may then resume the execution from the saved code state, terminate the script execution or continue the script from a different location in the code
// We will show different error handling methods:
// Basic use of Exceptions
// Creating a custom exception handler
// Multiple exceptions
// Re-throwing an exception
// Setting a top level exception handler
// Note: Exceptions should only be used with error conditions, and should not be used to jump to another place in the code at a specified point.
//-----------
// Try, throw and catch
// To avoid the error from the example above, we need to create the proper code to handle an exception.

// Proper exception code should include:

// try - A function using an exception should be in a "try" block. If the exception does not trigger, the code will continue as normal. However if the exception triggers, an exception is "thrown"
// throw - This is how you trigger an exception. Each "throw" must have at least one "catch"
// catch - A "catch" block retrieves an exception and creates an object containing the exception information
 //echo strrev("Hello World!");
